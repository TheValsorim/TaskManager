Task Manager API

A simple, yet powerful, Task Manager API built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic. This API allows users to manage tasks, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks. Each task has a title, description, and completion status. It leverages SQLAlchemy for database management, FastAPI for fast API creation, and Pydantic for data validation.
Features

    Create tasks: Add new tasks with a title, description, and completion status.

    Read tasks: Retrieve all tasks or a specific task by its ID.

    Update tasks: Edit a taskâ€™s details, including its title, description, and completion status.

    Delete tasks: Remove tasks from the database.

    Dynamic ID generation: Task IDs are dynamically assigned and managed by the database.

Technologies Used

    FastAPI: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.

    SQLAlchemy: A powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Python that provides a set of high-level API methods for interacting with relational databases.

    Pydantic: A data validation library that ensures the integrity of the input and output data.

    pytest: A testing framework for unit tests, ensuring API endpoints work correctly.
